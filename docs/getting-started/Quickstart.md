# Quickstart 

This quickstart guide will walk you through initial onboarding, API key generation, Ethereum private key creation, and transaction signing via Turnkey.

## Create your Turnkey Organization

1. Visit [app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial](https://app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial) and enter your email address
2. Confirm your email by clicking on the link inside of the confirmation email
3. Click "Continue"

4. Choose your first authenticator (laptop biometrics or security key)
5. Pick a name for your authenticator and click "Continue"
6. Pick a name for your organization and click "Continue"
7. Log in by clicking "Get started"

Once your log in is successful, you will land on the dashboard screen. You'll initially be on the Activities tab, and can explore the Users, Private Keys, Security, and Sub-Orgs tabs.

#### Find your Organization ID

**All public API endpoints need an organization ID**. You can copy your organization ID by clicking on the user dropdown in the top right corner of the app as shown in the image below.

For convenience, it's worth setting this as a permanent shell variable:

```sh
export ORGANIZATION_ID="<Your Org ID>"
```

## Create a new API Key

Turnkey API Keys are generic public / private key pairs. You can generate a new key via either Dashboard or CLI.

### Dashboard

<img src="/img/quickstart/create-api-key-1.png" alt="create api key screenshot 1" width="1200px"/>

1. Navigate to your user
2. Click on "Create API key"

<img src="/img/quickstart/create-api-key-2.png" alt="create api key screenshot 2" width="1200px"/>

3. Select "Generate API keys in-browser" and continue
4. Enter API key name(s)
5. Review, save/copy API key details, and approve

### CLI

#### Install `turnkey`

```sh
brew install tkhq/tap/turnkey
```

Note: We are employing  [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in this guide as a quick and easy install path. For an installation path that requires no trust in external parties, **refer to our [tkcli repo](https://github.com/tkhq/tkcli)**.

#### Generate a new API key

 In your Turnkey implementation, an API key authenticates all API requests.

When you run this command, Turnkeyâ€™s CLI generates a standard API key pair and **stores the API private key locally**. If you've run this command once already, add `-k keyname` to the end of the command below, replacing "keyname" with any name you'd like. Otherwise, run the command as written to use our default naming.

```sh
turnkey gen --organization $ORGANIZATION_ID --key-name demo
```

Copy the `publicKey` field in the output.

#### Add your public API Key

<img src="/img/quickstart/create-api-key-1.png" alt="create api key screenshot 1" width="1200px"/>

1. Navigate to your user via Dashboard
2. Click on "Create API key"

<img src="/img/quickstart/import-api-key.png" alt="import api key screenshot" width="1200px"/>

3. Select "Generate API keys via CLI" and continue
4. Enter API key details
5. Review and approve

Click on "Add new API keys" and enter a label for the public key you want to add. After this succeeds, you should be all set to interact with our Public API.

## Create a new Ethereum Private Key

You can also generate a new private key via either Dashboard or CLI.

### Dashboard

<img src="/img/quickstart/create-private-key.png" alt="create private key screenshot" width="1200px"/>

1. Navigate to the `Private Keys` tab
2. Enter private key details
3. Review and approve

ðŸ¥³ you've created a private key! Find it in the Activity Details, or back in the `Private Keys` tab.

### CLI

Creating a new private key is done with the `/private_keys` endpoint. We can use the Turnkey CLI as follows â€” note that the flag `-k demo` is directing the CLI to use your local API key named `demo`.

```
turnkey private-keys create --name "ETH Key" --address-format ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM --curve CURVE_SECP256K1 -k demo
```

Once the activity transitions to `COMPLETE`, visit the `Private Keys` tab in your dashboard and take note of the Key ID (e.g. `e624996e-11c4-48fb-ad56-874ff5a84615`), this is what we'll use to sign.

Let's set it as a variable so we can use it to easily sign a transaction in the next step:

```sh
export PRIVATE_KEY_ID="<Your Private Key ID>"
```

## Sign a Transaction

Now you can sign any Ethereum transaction you like with this new key with our [`sign_transaction` endpoint](https://turnkey.readme.io/reference/publicapiservice_signtransaction). Make sure to replace the `unsignedTransaction` below with your own. You can use our [simple transaction generator](https://build.tx.xyz) if you need a quick transaction for testing:

```sh
turnkey request --host api.turnkey.com --path /public/v1/submit/sign_transaction --body '{
    "timestampMs": "'"$(date +%s)"'000",
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_SIGN_TRANSACTION",
    "organizationId": "'"$ORGANIZATION_ID"'",
    "parameters": {
      "privateKeyId": "'"$PRIVATE_KEY_ID"'",
      "type": "TRANSACTION_TYPE_ETHEREUM",
      "unsignedTransaction": "<Your Transaction>"
    }
}' -k demo
```

Unlike the previous activity, `SIGN_TRANSACTION` *immediately* comes back as `COMPLETED` because Turnkey's signing-related activities are handled synchronously (we do not need to change any organization data). You can find the signature in the output of the command, or by visiting the activity details page for the `SIGN_TRANSACTION` activity.

If you'd like to broadcast your transaction, you can easily do so via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/pushTx).

## Sign a Transaction with `Ethers.js`

Turnkey provides a drop-in `Ethers` signer via the [`@turnkey/ethers`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/ethers) package on npm. You can use the signer to sign transactions, and bring your own provider to broadcast them.

Check out the example on GitHub where we create a new Ethereum address, then sign and broadcast a transaction using the Turnkey signer: <https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-ethers/>

## Sign a Transaction with `Viem`

Turnkey also provides a drop-in `Viem` signer via the [`@turnkey/viem`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/viem) package on npm. You can similarly use this signer to sign transactions, and bring your own provider to broadcast them.

Check out the example on GitHub where we create a new Ethereum address, then sign and broadcast a transaction using the Turnkey signer: <https://github.com/tkhq/sdk/tree/main/examples/with-viem/>
