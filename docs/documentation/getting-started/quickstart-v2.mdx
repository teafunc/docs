# Quickstart

Turnkey is a secure, flexible, and scalable piece of crypto infrastructure that allows for programmatic management of cryptographic keypairs and signing of crypto transactions. This guide will quickly get you started with Turnkey by walking you through the setup process.

## SignUp/Login

1. **Create your Turnkey Organization**

   - Visit [app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial](https://app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial) and enter your email address.
   - Confirm your email by clicking on the link inside the confirmation email.
   - Follow the prompts to add your first authenticator and create your organization.

2. **Get Organization ID**

   - Find your newly created organization ID in the user dropdown menu at the top right corner of the dashboard.
   - Reference this ID in your code or as an environment variable, as it is needed to make requests to the Turnkey API.

2. **Complete API Key Setup**
   - Select "Generate API keys in-browser" and click continue.
   - Name your API keypair and click continue.
   - Save your Public and Private Key locally.
   - Click "Approve" to sign the API Creation activity with your authenticator device.

### Important Notes

- Every action on Turnkey returns an `activity`, including creating the API keypair. Learn more about the [Turnkey Activity Model here](/concepts/policies/language#activity-breakdown).
- The keypair is an authenticator for the root user of your Turnkey organization. **Ensure that any code using an API keypair for the parent organization is stored securely server-side and never exposed to end-users**.
- Both the public and private key are required to sign requests to the Turnkey API.

This streamlined guide should help you get up and running with Turnkey quickly and efficiently.
