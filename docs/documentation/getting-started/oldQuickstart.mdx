# Quickstart

Turnkey is a secure, flexible, and scalable piece of crypto infrastructure that allows for programmatic management of cryptographic keypairs and signing of crypto transactions. The guide below will walk you through Turnkey's onboarding, and using Turnkey's SDK to programmatically create a wallet and sign your first Ethereum transaction. It will also walk you through a common flow for creating a non-custodial wallet on behalf of another user, and having that user sign their first Ethereum transaction using a passkey authenticator.

### Create your Turnkey Organization

- Visit [app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial](https://app.turnkey.com/dashboard/auth/initial) and enter your email address
- Confirm your email by clicking on the link inside of the confirmation email
- Follow the prompts to add your first authenticator and create your organization

You can find your newly created organization ID in the user dropdown menu at the top right corner of the dashboard.

<img
  src="/img/quickstart/find_organization_id.png"
  alt="Find organization ID"
  style={{ width: 940 }}
/>

You'll want to reference this in your code or as an environment variable, as you'll need it to make requests to the Turnkey API.

### Create an API Key

Turnkey API Keys consist of P-256 public / private keypairs that allow you to make authenticated requests to Turnkey's API. You can create an API Key from your user page of the dashboard. Navigate to your user page by clicking on "User Details" in the user dropdown menu, and then click "Create an API key".

<img
  src="/img/quickstart/find_user_details.png"
  alt="Find user details"
  style={{ width: 940 }}
/>

<img
  src="/img/quickstart/create_api_key.png"
  alt="Find user details"
  style={{ width: 940 }}
/>

- Select "Generate API keys in-browser" and click continue.
- Give your API keypair a name and click continue.
- Save your Public and Private Key locally.
- Make sure to click "Approve" to sign the API Creation activity with your authenticator device.

A couple of notes on the action you just took:

- Every action on Turnkey returns an `activity`, including creating the API keypair in the previous step. You can read more about the full [Turnkey Activity Model here](/concepts/policies/language#activity-breakdown).
- The keypair you just created is an authenticator for the root user of your Turnkey organization. **Any code using an API keypair for the parent organization should only ever be used and stored securely server-side, and never exposed to end-users**.
- You will need both the public and private key to sign requests to the Turnkey API.

### Instantiate Turnkey using the Server SDK

The simplest way to use Turnkey's API is through one of our SDK libraries. This example will make requests to the API using our server-side node.js library. You can see the full list of client libraries supported on our [SDK Reference page.](/sdks/introduction). Additionally, if you're looking for an example to get started, here are some fullstack Next.js apps that use [Ethers](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-ethers-passkeys) and [Viem](https://github.com/tkhq/demo-viem-passkeys), respectively.

#### Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```bash
yarn add @turnkey/sdk-server
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @turnkey/sdk-server
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Initialize an `apiClient`

There are multiple ways to authenticate a request to Turnkey's API. The `apiClient` is how you make requests using a public/private keypair (like the one you created above). The `apiClient` needs two additional parameters as well as the private and public key:

1. the `apiBaseUrl` that you are making requests to (you will use https://api.turnkey.com when making requests to Turnkey's production API)
2. the `defaultOrganizationId` to make requests on behalf of (you can use the organization ID you saved above).

```typescript
import { Turnkey } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";

const turnkey = new Turnkey({
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com",
  apiPrivateKey: process.env.TURNKEY_API_PRIVATE_KEY,
  apiPublicKey: process.env.TURNKEY_API_PUBLIC_KEY,
  defaultOrganizationId: process.env.TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID,
});

const apiClient = turnkey.apiClient();
```

### Create a Wallet

A [hierarchical deterministic (HD) Wallet](https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/hd-wallets) is a collection of cryptographic private/public keypairs that share a common seed. For simplicity, you can think of a `wallet` as a collection of `accounts` where each `account` has a single `address` associated with it. An `address` is a string such as `0x7aAE6F67798D1Ea0b8bFB5b64231B2f12049DB5e` that you reference when you want to transfer funds to someone.

You can read more about how Turnkey implements wallets in our [Wallet guide.](/concepts/wallets)

In order to create a wallet you can call `createWallet` and pass in the name of the wallet, as well as any accounts that you want to derive when creating the wallet. In this example, we will create a new wallet and create a single Ethereum account along with it.

Note: You can always add new accounts to a wallet later using the `createWalletAccounts` method.

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";

const walletResponse = await apiClient.createWallet({
  walletName: "Example Wallet 1",
  accounts: DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS,
});

const walletId = walletResponse.walletId;
const accountAddress = walletResponse.addresses[0];
```

You should now be able to see your newly created wallet on your Turnkey dashboard in the Wallets section.

### Sign a Transaction

A Turnkey client can be used as a signer alongside many popular web3 libraries. You can see the full list of supported web3 integrations [here](/category/web3-libraries). In this example, we will use [Turnkey's Ethers.js wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/ethers) to sign and broadcast a transaction. Note that we also support [Viem](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turnkey/viem).

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```bash
yarn add ethers
yarn add @turnkey/ethers
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install ethers
npm install @turnkey/ethers
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { TurnkeySigner } from "@turnkey/ethers";

const turnkeySigner = new TurnkeySigner({
  client: apiClient,
  organizationId: process.env.TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID,
  signWith: accountAddress
})

// a provider is required if you want to interact with the live network,
// i.e. broadcast transactions, fetch gas prices, etc.
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(<provider API URL>);
const connectedSigner = turnkeySigner.connect(provider);

const transactionRequest = {
  to: <destination address>,
  value: ethers.parseEther(<amount to send>),
  type: 2
}
const transactionResult = await connectedSigner.sendTransaction(transactionRequest);
```

And that's it, you have sent your first Ethereum transaction without ever having to manage private key material on your own server!

Sending transactions this way provides a **much stronger security model** than managing key material directly on your own servers, but the real power of Turnkey comes from its extensibility. In the next section we will show you how to create fully non-custodial wallets on behalf of your users, where users can sign transactions themselves using passkeys.

---

## Create a Non-Custodial Wallet for a User

The following example will walk you through a simple flow for having a user create a wallet as a configurable `subOrganization` of your parent Turnkey organization. This gives you full control of the policies and access controls associated with the wallet when it's created.

For a more comprehensive breakdown of all our embedded wallet flows you can read our [Embedded Wallets Guide.](/embedded-wallets/overview)

### Instantiate Turnkey using the Browser SDK

Turnkey offers a browser SDK which includes utilities for leveraging native browser APIs in addition to facilitating calls to Turnkey's API. These utilities enable the creation and management of user passkeys and the storage of user login sessions among other things.

#### Installation

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn" default>

```bash
yarn add @turnkey/sdk-browser
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
npm install @turnkey/sdk-browser
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Initialize a `passkeyClient`

```typescript
import { Turnkey } from "@turnkey/sdk-browser";

const turnkey = new Turnkey({
  apiBaseUrl: "https://api.turnkey.com",
  defaultOrganizationId: process.env.TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID,
});

const passkeyClient = turnkey.passkeyClient();
```

#### Create a Local Passkey Credential

This will prompt a user natively in their browser to create a passkey.

```typescript
const credential = await passkeyClient.createUserPasskey({
  publicKey: {
    user: {
      name: <userName>,
      displayName: <userDisplayName>
    }
  }
})

// now, you can specify this credential when you create a sub-organization below
```

#### Configure the `subOrganization` for the User

In this example flow, you are creating a segregated `subOrganization` for each end-user. Each `subOrganization` can have it's own policies associated with it. The `subOrganization` can be configured in any way, including shared custodial setups that require multisig schemes to execute. In this example config, you are creating a wallet where only the end-user has the ability to approve signing, with the passkey credential they created above.

```typescript
import { DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS } from "@turnkey/sdk-server";

// receive posted credential

const subOrganizationConfig = {
  subOrganizationName: <subOrganizationName>,
  rootUsers: [{
    userName: <userName>,
    userEmail: <userEmail>,
    apiKeys: [],
    authenticators: [
      {
        authenticatorName: <authenticatorName>,
        challenge: credential.challenge,
        attestation: credential.attestation
      }
    ],
    oauthProviders: []
  }],
  rootQuorumThreshold: 1,
  wallet: {
    walletName: <initialWalletName>,
    accounts: DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS
  }
}
```

#### Call `createSubOrganization` from your `apiClient`

The call to `createSubOrganization` must ultimately be done using the parent organization credentials, which is why we make the call from the server-side `apiClient`.

```typescript
const subOrganizationResponse = await apiClient.createSubOrganization(
  subOrganizationConfig,
);
```

### Make user requests

Once the `subOrganization` has been created, all future activities on that `subOrganization` can be authenticated from the end-user's passkey credential, and performed directly from the `passkeyClient` in the browser SDK. A user could authenticate the call to create another wallet on their account with the following code.

```typescript
const walletResponse = await passkeyClient.createWallet({
  walletName: "Wallet Created with User Authentication",
  accounts: DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS,
});

const walletId = walletResponse.walletId;
const accountAddress = walletResponse.addresses[0];
```

#### Sign a Transaction

```typescript
import { ethers } from "ethers";
import { TurnkeySigner } from "@turnkey/ethers";

const turnkeySigner = new TurnkeySigner({
  client: passkeyClient,
  organizationId: process.env.TURNKEY_ORGANIZATION_ID,
  signWith: accountAddress
})

// a provider is required if you want to interact with the live network,
// i.e. broadcast transactions, fetch gas prices, etc.
const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(<provider API URL>);
const connectedSigner = turnkeySigner.connect(provider);

const transactionRequest = {
  to: <destination address>,
  value: ethers.parseEther(<amount to send>),
  type: 2
}
const transactionResult = await connectedSigner.sendTransaction(transactionRequest);
```

#### Login a User

Whenever you call a method on `passkeySigner` the browser will prompt the end-user for a passkey signature to use as an authentication credential for the request to Turnkey's API. This is good when used for stateful write actions to their `subOrganization`, but a bit cumbersome when used for reading data from their account. In order to make this UX feel more streamlined, the browser SDK offers a way to `login` a user and then subsequently make read-only requests to Turnkey's API via a login session instead of needing an end-user to tap a passkey each time.

```typescript
const response = await passkeyClient.login();
if (response.organizationId) {
  // user is authenticated with Turnkey
} else {
  // user was not authenticated with Turnkey
}
```

Once a user has been logged in, you will have access to the `currentUserSession` to call Turnkey's API. The following example will return a list of wallets for the logged-in user.

```typescript
const currentUserSession = await turnkey.currentUserSession();

if (currentUserSession) {
  // this request will not require the user to tap a passkey
  const walletsResponse = await currentUserSession.getWallets();
  const allUserWallets = walletsResponse.wallets;
}
```
