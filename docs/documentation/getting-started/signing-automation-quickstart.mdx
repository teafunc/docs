# Signing Automation Quickstart

Turnkey's Signing Automation enables you to build secure, programmatic signing workflows directly into your applications. With features like customizable policies, multi-party approvals, and support for any blockchain, you can confidently automate complex signing operations while maintaining enterprise-grade security.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes you've completed the steps to create an account and organization as described in the [Getting Started](/getting-started) section.

## Installation

Install the Turnkey CLI to get started:

```sh
brew install tkhq/tap/turnkey
```

We use Homebrew for a quick installation process. For a more secure installation that requires no trust in external parties, see our [CLI repository](https://github.com/tkhq/tkcli).

<Steps>

<Step> Create Wallet</Step>

Wallets are collections of cryptographic key pairs typically used for sending and receiving digital assets. To create one, we need to provide a name:

```sh
turnkey wallets create --name default --key-name quickstart
```


<Step> Create Ethereum Account</Step>

To create a cryptographic key pair on our new Wallet, we need to pass our desired address format:

```sh
turnkey wallets accounts create --wallet default --address-format ADDRESS_FORMAT_ETHEREUM --key-name quickstart
````

This command will produce an Ethereum address (e.g. `0x08cb1216C95149DF66978b574E484869512CE2bF`) that we'll need to sign a transaction. You can see your new Wallet account with:

```sh
turnkey wallets accounts list --wallet default --key-name quickstart
```

<Step> Sign a Transaction</Step>

</Steps>


## Sign a Transaction

Now you can sign an Ethereum transaction with this new address with our [`sign_transaction` endpoint](https://docs.turnkey.com/api#tag/Signers/operation/SignTransaction). Make sure to replace the `unsignedTransaction` below with your own. You can use our [simple transaction generator](https://build.tx.xyz) if you need a quick transaction for testing:

```sh
turnkey request --path /public/v1/submit/sign_transaction --body '{
    "timestampMs": "'"$(date +%s)"'000",
    "type": "ACTIVITY_TYPE_SIGN_TRANSACTION_V2",
    "organizationId": "'"$ORGANIZATION_ID"'",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "TRANSACTION_TYPE_ETHEREUM",
      "signWith": "<Your Ethereum address>",
      "unsignedTransaction": "<Your Transaction>"
    }
}' --key-name quickstart
```

If you'd like to broadcast your transaction, you can easily do so via [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/pushTx).
