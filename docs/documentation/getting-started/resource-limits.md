# Resource Limits

We have limits on the number of resources within a single organization to avoid performance slowdowns and overly complex permission models. You can scale your organizational resources beyond these limits via [sub-organizations](/concepts/Sub-Organizations). You can create an unlimited number of sub-organizations within a single organization.

Currently, the resource limits within a single organization are as follows:

| Resource                       | Maximum parent org allowance | Maximum sub-org allowance |
| :----------------------------- | :---------------------------:| :-----------------------: |
| Private keys                   | 1,000                        | 1,000                     |
| HD Wallets                     | 100                          | 100                       |
| HD Wallet Accounts             | unlimited                    | unlimited                 |
| Users                          | 100                          | 100                       |
| Policies                       | 100                          | 100                       |
| Invitations                    | 100                          | 100                       |
| Tags                           | 100                          | 10                        |
| Authenticators per user        | 10                           | 10                        |
| API keys per user (long-lived) | 10                           | 10                        |
| API keys per user (expiring)   | 10                           | 10                        |
| Sub-Organizations              | unlimited                    | 0                         |
