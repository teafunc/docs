The default `subOrganizationConfig` outlined below will create a fully non-custodial wallet that can only be controlled by the credentials of the single root user. However, there are some designs that might want to use shared custodial setups.

<CodeBlock language="typescript">
{`import { DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS } from "@turnkey/sdk-browser;"`}
{`\n\nconst subOrganizationConfig = {
  subOrganizationName: <subOrganizationName>,
  rootUsers: [{
    userName: <userEmail>,
    userEmail: <userEmail>,
    apiKeys: [],
    authenticators: []
  }],
  rootQuorumThreshold: 1,
  wallet: {
    walletName: <walletName>,
    accounts: DEFAULT_ETHEREUM_ACCOUNTS
  }
};
`}
</CodeBlock>

#### Migrating a shared custodial `subOrganization` to fully non-custodial
